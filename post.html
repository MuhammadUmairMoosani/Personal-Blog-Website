        <h3>Christ The Redeemer, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil</h3>
        <p>
          Even if you’re not religious, you need to see the statue of Christ The
          Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. The immense structure is an
          incredible combination of artistic creativity and ingenious
          engineering. From on top of Mount Corcovado, the staggering 38-meter
          tall statue looms over the city below, arms outstretched in
          benediction. But it’s not until you get up close, you’ll realize just
          how big the statue is and you’ll start to wonder how they ever got it
          up there in the first place. It is that colossal.
        </p>
        <h4>Reaching Those Dizzy Heights</h4>
        <p>
          Don’t let the altitude of the statue put you off going to see it
          either. Although you can hike your way up, which will make you feel
          like a true explorer, there’s also a tram which winds its way up Mount
          Corcovado through the forest and is far less strenuous on your legs.
          At the end of the tram line, you’ll find a minibus waiting to take you
          on the final, vertigo-inspiring, leg of the journey.
        </p>
        <h4>When to go</h4>
        <p>
          The best time to go has to be when Rio de Janeiro’s amazing carnival
          is in full swing. Yes, it’s going to be busy. In fact, the streets
          will be packed, teeming with party-goers, loud music, and incredible
          parades. It is the world’s biggest party and the electric atmosphere
          is one experience you really can’t afford to miss. Never mind the tram
          or hiking up to the statue, once you’ve caught the rhythm of the
          music, you’ll be samba dancing up the mountain.
